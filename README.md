# Retro-Shooters
Retro Shooters is a fixed shooter game in which the player is in a spaceship and the space ship has a missile shooter. The player can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as four rows of six that moves left and right as a group, shifting downward each time it reaches a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. The aliens attempt to destroy the player's spaceship by firing bombs. The game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen or the spaceship gets hit by one of the aliens bomb.
